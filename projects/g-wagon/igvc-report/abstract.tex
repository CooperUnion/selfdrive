  The Cooper IGVC Team is the primary research group of Cooper Unionâ€™s Autonomy
  Lab. As an organization, we're dedicated to cultivating autonomous
  vehicle research at our institution. We also work to uplift the Cooper
  community through the mentorship of underclassmen with the development
  of workshops to cultivate skills generalizable to complex projects
  outside of IGVC. We pride ourselves on building our car full-stack.
  Students in Autonomy Lab have designed all core mechanical, electronic,
  and software systems, all of which are open source.
