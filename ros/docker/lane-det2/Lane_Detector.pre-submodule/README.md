PSES - Lane Detector

## Requirements:
* ROS (code tested with ROS Indigo)
* MRPT:
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:joseluisblancoc/mrpt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmrpt-dev
```

## Use:
* To use lane detector with the PSES-Car in a real scenario:
```sh
roslaunch lane_detector lane_follower.launch
```
* To use lane detector with an image dataset:
```sh
roslaunch lane_detector lane_follower_simulation.launch
```

## Subscribed Topics:
* /image (sensor_msgs/Image): Input image.
* /camera_info (sensor_msgs/CameraInfo): Camera calibration data.
* /lane_detector/driving_orientation (std_msgs::Int32): Topic to change lane. 0 to drive on the right and 1 to drive on the left.

## Published Topics:
* /lane_detector/lane (lane_detector::Lane)

## lane_detector/Lane ROS-Message:
* header (Header): Header with time stamp
* left_line (geometry_msgs/Point32[]): Sorted Array of points with the x,y coordinates (in meters) of the left line.  
* right_line (geometry_msgs/Point32[]): Sorted Array of points with the x,y coordinates (in meters) of the right line.
* guide_line (geometry_msgs/Point32[]): Sorted Array of points with the x,y coordinates (in meters) of the guide (middle) line.

## Additional Requirements:
* The used camera has to be calibrated and should send the calibration data over the camera_info topic.
* The camera extrinsics (height and pitch angle) have to be known and should be set with dynamic reconfigure with:
```sh
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```
* The used camera has to have both lane marks in sight while driving a curve.
