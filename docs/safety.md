## Using Equipment

You **must** wear goggles (and electric gloves if handling high
voltage). This includes, but is not limited to: mechanical maintenance,
using hand/power tools, cutting/stripping wire, soldering, etc...

*When jacking a car:*

- Wait until clear before jacking or releasing jack
- Announce "ALL CLEAR, JACKING (FRONT OR BACK)"
- Announce "ALL CLEAR, LOWERING" when releasing the jack
- NO ONE allowed under car when it is on jacks (no exceptions)

*When going under a car:*

- Put up caution tape or assign someone else to watch the car so people
  coming nearby know to stay clear of the car
- Do not go under the car until you are sure it is safe to do so
- Announce "GOING UNDER CAR" to make sure everyone near the car knows
  not to sit inside or move the car

*When operating experimental components:*

- Confirm the component works on a lab bench before testing on a project
- Ensure there is a safe way to disengage the component

### When car is in 701:

- Ensure car will not drive into wall (put car on dollies or use chock
  blocks at all times)
- Have the car face at the wall where it won’t hit the hallway or anyone
  else in case it drives forward by itself
- Avoid keeping the car on it’s wheels unless needed for testing (Use
  jack stands as needed)

### When using power tools / drills:

- Announce/ shout out “ALL CLEAR, DRILLING” so that all in car know to
  be clear
- Make sure all are clear before using tool
- Ensure item you are drilling into is clamped in some way so that it
  doesn’t go flying or break
- Use step bits when possible for drilling into plastic

### When wiring to a battery (if battery leads are exposed):

- Make sure all are clear before removing tape / no one is touching
  other side of battery to prevent shorts
- If anything is loose or hanging use electric tape to prevent any
  accidental shorts
- Use battery boots (when possible)
- If battery shorts, STOP what you're doing, turn off all systems to
  prevent further damage, identify problem.

### When soldering:

- Ensure some sort of fan/filter is on (either the ceiling air sucker or
  the mini fan)
- Ensure soldering iron is not left on when finished

### When using Heat-Gun

- Make sure ONLY pointing at items want to heat up
- Keep others clear when heat gun is on
- Ensure heat gun is turned off when finished

## Test Day Procedures

*In general:*

- If not directly testing, **stay clear**
- Do not distract people testing as it may cause a lapse in judgement
- Save non-urgent questions for when people are not actively testing

*Test day safety officer:*

- One person is assigned to be safety officer for the day
- Ensures people follow safety protocols
- Designated as person to call 911 and use the fire extinguisher
- Responsible for asking people not following safety protocol to leave
  the test environment

*When a car is armed:*

- A car is considered armed if the key is in the ignition or
  microcontrollers are powered
- Nobody is to be in front of an armed car, **no exceptions**
- A fire extinguisher must be inside the car at all times
- Avoid using tools
- Take extreme care not to short anything
- If anything shorts, smokes, or explores, **stop** immediately, turn
  off **all** systems, and call for help before identifying the problem

*When outside of 41CS:*

- Secure the test area with caution tape and orange cones
- Have a megaphone in case an announcement needs to be made

*Before a test day, confirm the following:*

- Is there a designated safety officer?
- Are E-STOPs functional?
- Is weather suitable?
- Is there a lab technician or someone certified who agreed they'd be
  with you during the duration of the test?
- Is the school grounds team aware of what section of the sidewalk will
  be blocked off for testing?
- Ensure everyone participating is informed of the tests and the risks
  associated with them
