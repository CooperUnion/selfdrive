# Safety Policies & Procedures

The importance of this safety guide is to:

1. Ensure nobody gets harmed and reduce the risk of getting harmed
2. How to prevent easily avoidable mistakes
3. Reduce damage

## General

*If something starts smoking:*

- Press the E-STOP and turn off all power immediately
- Clear the lab
- Call for help

*In case of fire:*

- There is a fire extinguisher on inside of the g-wagon
- There is a larger fire extinguisher right outside 701

## When Using Equipment:

### MUST:

- Wear goggles
- Wear electrical gloves (if handling +48V line)
- Place chock blocks on wheels if tires are not on dollies

This includes but not limited to: mechanical maintenance, using hand
tools, using power tools, cutting/stripping wire, soldering

### When jacking car:

- Announce “ALL CLEAR, JACKING FRONT” or “JACKING BACK”
- Announce “ALL CLEAR, LOWERING” when releasing the jack
- Wait until clear before jacking or releasing jack

### When going under car:

- Announce / shout out “GOING UNDER CAR” to make sure everyone near the
  car knows not to sit inside the car or move the car
- Do not go under car until sure no one is going to sit in car / move
  car
- Put up caution tape or assign someone else to watch car or stand at
  door so people coming in know not to go into car while you are under
  the car

### When operating experimental boards / devices / new additions to car:

- Check that it works on a node not plugged into car first
- Check board is not being back-powered through battery device
- Operate with power supply before connecting to electronics to car

### When car is in 701:

- Ensure car will not drive into wall (put car on dollies or use chock
  blocks at all times)
- Have the car face at the wall where it won’t hit the hallway or anyone
  else in case it drives forward by itself
- Avoid keeping the car on it’s wheels unless needed for testing
- Even this should be avoided by using the jack stands in the lab

### When using power tools / drills:

- Announce/ shout out “ALL CLEAR, DRILLING” so that all in car know to
  be clear
- Make sure all are clear before using tool
- Ensure item you are drilling into is clamped in some way so that it
  doesn’t go flying or break
- Use step bits when possible for drilling into plastic

### When wiring to a battery (if battery leads are exposed):

- Make sure all are clear before removing tape / no one is touching
  other side of battery to prevent shorts
- If anything is loose or hanging use electric tape to prevent any
  accidental shorts
- Use battery boots (when possible)
- If battery shorts, STOP what you're doing, turn off all systems to
  prevent further damage, identify problem.

### When soldering:

- Ensure some sort of fan/filter is on (either the ceiling air sucker or
  the mini fan)
- Ensure soldering iron is not left on when finished

### When using Heat-Gun

- Make sure ONLY pointing at items want to heat up
- Keep others clear when heat gun is on
- Ensure heat gun is turned off when finished

## Test Day Procedures

*In general:*

- If not directly testing, **stay clear**
- Do not distract people testing as it may cause a lapse in judgement
- Save non-urgent questions for when people are not actively testing

*Test day safety officer:*

- One person is assigned to be safety officer for the day
- Ensures people follow safety protocols
- Designated as person to call 911 and use the fire extinguisher
- Responsible for asking people not following safety protocol to leave
  the test environment

### When car is ARMED

- Armed means any of the following: Key is in ignition, Node boards are
  powered
- Take extreme care not to short connections
- If possible, turn off car / nodes before using metal tools on the
  boards (metal snips, screw drivers, etc)
- If anything shorts / makes smoke/ explodes, STOP what you're doing,
  call for help, turn all systems OFF to prevent further damages,
  identify problem before moving on
- If working with something connected to a battery, take even more care
  not to short components

*When outside of 41CS:*

- Secure the test area with caution tape and orange cones
- Have a megaphone in case an announcement needs to be made

### Before commencing Test Day run through safety checklist:

- Who is designated student safety officer?
- Does the ESTOP work as intended?
- Is the weather suitable for a test day?
- Is there a lab technician or someone certified who agreed they’d be
  with you during the duration of the test day?
- Is the school grounds team aware of what section of the sidewalk will
  be blocked for testing?
- Make sure all members present for test day understand what system is
  being tested when and are conscious of any dangers that maybe
  associated with it
