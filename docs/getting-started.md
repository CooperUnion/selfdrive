# Getting Started

[`selfdrive`] is a rather *complicated* repo.

If you've never worked on a project of this scale, it can be daunting to
know where to start. The goal of this guide is to give you enough of a
foothold to start asking the right questions and to begin your adventure
here at Autonomy Lab.

## Fundamentals

Before we even get to cloning [`selfdrive`], you need to have the basic
mechanical skills required to traverse a shell. [MIT's Missing Semester]
serves as a great starting point for just this. The following table
lists the lectures you should watch if you plan to work on a specific
Autonomy Lab group:

| Lecture                       | Hardware | Firmware | Algorithms |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| [Course overview + the shell] | ✓\*      | ✓\*      | ✓\*        |
| [Shell Tools and Scripting]   | ✓        | ✓\*      | ✓\*        |
| [Editors (Vim)]               |          |          |            |
| [Data Wrangling]              |          | ✓        | ✓\*        |
| [Command-line Environment]    | ✓        | ✓\*      | ✓\*        |
| [Version Control (Git)]       | ✓\*      | ✓\*      | ✓\*        |
| [Debugging and Profiling]     |          | ✓        | ✓          |
| [Metaprogramming]             |          | ✓        | ✓          |
| [Security and Cryptography]   |          |          |            |
| [Potpourri]                   |          | ✓        | ✓          |
| [Q&A]                         |          | ✓        | ✓          |

> *Note: an `*` denotes you should also do the associated exercises.*

At a minimum, to clone [`selfdrive`], you should watch and do the
exercises for [Course overview + the shell] and [Version Control (Git)],
as these lectures provide you the fundamentals to hit the ground
running.
