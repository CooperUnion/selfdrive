# Getting Started

[`selfdrive`] is a rather *complicated* repo.

If you've never worked on a project of this scale, it can be daunting to
know where to start. The goal of this guide is to give you enough of a
foothold to start asking the right questions and to begin your adventure
here at Autonomy Lab.
