# Contributing

Thank you for taking time out of your day to contribute! We're excited
to have you contribute to our documentation, but before you do, let's go
over how best to contribute.

## Before You Start

Before you get to writing anything, ask yourself a few questions:

- Can existing documentation be improved?
- If the existing documentation is insufficient, can it be expanded?
- Have you generalized to a reasonable degree?
- Is what you're about to write correct to the best of your knowledge?

> *As an aside, no documentation is better than wrong documentation!*
