# Brake-By-Cable

We designed the Brake-By-Cable, or BBC, as the autonomous braking system
for the g-wagon. A steel cable pulls on the brake pedal to reduce the
velocity of and stop the car.

## System Overview

Based on the pressure in the master cylinder, a DC motor rotates a
pulley, pulling on one side of a lever. The other side of the lever
pulls on the brake pedal with more force, enough force to stop the car.

NOTE: We are still in process of testing & designing this system. As
improvements and design changes are made, we will update the
documentation.

Documentation is divided into:

- Mechanical design & assembly
- Controlling the motor
- Reading the pressure sensor
